# Future Of Technical Communications


Technology brings the world closer; communication binds the world.

Today technology has touched all fields of lives in one way or the other.

Efficiency and accuracy decide the success of a product. In today’s fast-paced world, another deciding factor has become the heartbeat of the product and application market and that is usability.

*Design isn’t finished until somebody is using it.* - Brenda Laurel, PhD, Independent Scholar

To address dynamically changing situations and needs, industries are developing numerous products. Most of these products offer a wide variety of features. Technical communication completes the product by making it usable and maintainable.

Technical communication integrates the industrial environment with human life. It humanizes technology. On one hand, it simplifies the product for the users and on the other, it reduces human dependency. Good product documentation keeps the product alive even beyond the original product creators. It facilitates product integrations, takeovers, and maintenance.

Transformation and evolution are an inevitable part of progress. Technical communication is bound to evolve with technology. Online help, video tutorials, etc. have become an add-on to print manuals.
The technical communications field is contributing to other areas such as development, training, marketing, etc. For example, many new writing tools are being developed for use by technical communicators which in turn provide an opportunity for the software industry.

As long as industry, science, and technology are evolving there is always a need for simplifying, documenting, maintaining, and communicating information.  Thus making the future of technical communication  bright.
